# Forest Map Generator (ROS2 + Gazebo Fortress)

A ROS 2 package for generating forest terrain maps and simulation assets for Gazebo.
The package provides tools for terrain heightmap manipulation, point cloud–based
tree model generation, and structured forest environment construction.

## Overview

This package supports the generation of large-scale forest simulation environments
by combining terrain heightmaps with procedurally generated tree models.
It is designed for robotics research involving perception, navigation, and
environment interaction in natural outdoor scenarios.
